# LUMIERE VOD ARCHIVER

This is a simple "set and forget"-script that can be set up to run independently to archive the LUMIERE VoD database by the European Audiovisual Observatory, through e.g. chronjobs.


OBS: This downloads the entire database each time it is run: please don't run it unnecessarily often. LUMIERE VoD has historically predominantly published new datasets 3-4 times a year. Running this once a month will surely suffice.

#TODO: Explain how this works :-) 

Planned development: Set up external service to be notified of errors and new datasets.
